Setup to be played with keyboard+mouse and an xbox controller on Mac
Other setups may work incorrectly, Iâ€™ve been having issues with the input manager cross-platform and with different controllers

Controls:

Keyboard:
WASD to move
Mouse to aim
Mouse left and right to attack left and right
Q and E to parry left and right

Controller:
LS to move
RS to aim
LT and RT to attack left and right
LB and RB to parry left and right
