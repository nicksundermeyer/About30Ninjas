Notes on Milestone 3:
* game mechanics - sword fighting is the mechanic, implemented striking and parrying on both sides of the two players with multiple inputs
* finalized art - everything has art
* animations - animation system tied to the attack/parry system of the gameplay, in addition to interrupting and recoiling from strikes
* sound effects and music - background music, effects for attacking, blocking, striking
* scene transitions - main menu screen, which can either quit or transition to main game screen. when game ends, has option to restart scene
* additional levels - not needed, arena-brawler type game
* ai - my game didn’t need ai per se because the two players fight each other, so I instead just implemented some little bugs that run around underfoot randomly. Doesn’t affect gameplay but just a visual thing to fulfill the requirement
* coroutines - coroutines used for animating sword strikes, playing sounds, and the bug movement
* ui - there is a ui

Setup to be played with keyboard+mouse and an xbox controller on Mac
Other setups may work incorrectly, I’ve been having issues with the input manager cross-platform and with different controllers

I realize this is a hard type of game to test with only one player, but hopefully you will still be able to get what I’m going for with the pvp combat and parrying mechanics even if you can’t fully play the game by yourself.

Controls:

Keyboard:
WASD to move
Mouse to aim
Mouse left and right to attack left and right
Q and E to parry left and right

Controller:
LS to move
RS to aim
LT and RT to attack left and right
LB and RB to parry left and right
